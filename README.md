# Predicting_Hospital_Stay_Length_Using_Explainable_Machine_Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the length of hospital stay for patients based on clinical and demographic features. Accurately forecasting hospital stay duration can help hospitals in optimizing resource allocation, reducing costs, and improving patient care planning.
