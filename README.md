# Predicting_Hospital_Stay_Length_Using_Explainable_Machine_Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the length of hospital stay for patients based on clinical and demographic features. Accurately forecasting hospital stay duration can help hospitals in optimizing resource allocation, reducing costs, and improving patient care planning.
Key Features:
📊 Data preprocessing & handling missing values
⚙️ Multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
🧠 Model evaluation with metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R²
🔎 Explainable AI integration using SHAP.
📈 Visualizations of feature importance and impact
 Goal:
To build a reliable and interpretable ML model that assists hospitals in predicting how long a patient is likely to stay, enabling better management and personalized care.
